# Economic Calendar API Status

## Current Issue: FMP Requires Paid Subscription

### Problem
The FMP (Financial Modeling Prep) economic calendar endpoint returns **402 Payment Required**:

```
FMP API error: 402 Payment Required - Restricted Endpoint:
This endpoint is not available under your current subscription.
Please visit https://financialmodelingprep.com/ to upgrade your plan.
```

###  Current Status
- ❌ FMP Economic Calendar: **Requires paid subscription** (402)
- ❓ Alpha Vantage: Need to verify if they offer economic calendar
- ❓ Twelve Data: Need to verify availability
- ✅ Static Fallback: **Working** - Shows next 7 days dynamically

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Upgrade FMP Subscription
- Cost: Check FMP pricing tiers
- Benefit: Official, reliable economic data
- URL: https://financialmodelingprep.com/pricing

### Option 2: Use Alternative Free API
Potential free sources:
1. **Trading Economics** (https://tradingeconomics.com/api)
   - Has free tier with limited calls
   - Comprehensive economic calendar

2. **MarketCalendar** (https://www.marketcalendar.com/)
   - Free economic calendar data
   - May require API key

3. **Alpha Vantage REAL_GDP, CPI, etc.**
   - Individual economic indicators (not a calendar)
   - Free tier: 25 requests/day

### Option 3: Keep Current Dynamic Fallback
- Shows next 7 days with placeholder events
- No real data, but calendar remains functional
- Good for UI/UX demonstration

## Recommendations

### Short Term
Keep the current dynamic fallback (already implemented) which generates the next 7 days automatically. This ensures the calendar tab remains functional.

### Long Term
1. Test if Alpha Vantage has economic calendar endpoint
2. Research Trading Economics API integration
3. Consider FMP subscription upgrade if economic calendar is critical

## Implementation Notes

The calendar-economic.js endpoint has been updated with:
- ✅ Dynamic 7-day fallback (instead of stale October data)
- ✅ Proper error logging
- ✅ Fallback chain: FMP → Alpha Vantage → Twelve Data → Static

Even without paid APIs, users see current week dates rather than old data.
